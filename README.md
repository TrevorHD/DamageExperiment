# Overview

Invasive species are often disturbance-adapted; this includes not only natural disturbances but, unfortunately, the disturbances we apply as part of management regimes. As both natural and intervention-based perturbations are potentially impacted by broader environmental changes, effective management of these species may become even more challenging. Here, we investigate whether climate change in the form of increased growing temperatures affects management outcomes, using repeated mowing of the common invasive thistles *Carduus nutans* and *Carduus acanthoides* as a representative study system. Weekly mowing regimes of differing intensity explored how repeated disturbance affects survival, growth, and reproduction, as well as whether these repeated mowing treatments were less effective on individuals grown at temperatures 0.6°C above ambient. Only the most intense regime reduced average lifespan for both species. All mowing treatments significantly impacted growth and reproduction: maximum heights were lower (which would decrease dispersal), disrupted apical dominance increased stem count, and no mowed individuals produced viable seed. While higher temperatures increased maximum thistle height across mowing treatments, there was little evidence for significant effects on survival or reproduction, or that the effects of increased growing temperatures on survival, growth, or reproduction varied depending on mowing intensity. However, for lightly trimmed *C. acanthoides*, we find that higher temperatures reduced the effectiveness of mowing on reducing thistle lifespans. These results indicate that mowing, when performed on a regular basis and at sufficient intensity, can provide enough disturbance to hamper the survival and reproduction of invasive or weedy species. Though increased growing temperatures had little effect overall, the fact that they reduced the effectiveness of one of the mowing regimes illustrates that climate change may affect existing management practices, and indicates a need for further investigation.
